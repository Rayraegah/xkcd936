The comic illustrates the relative strength of passwords assuming
basic knowledge of the system used to generate them.

This comic says that a password such as `Tr0ub4dor&3` is bad because it is
easy for password cracking software and hard for humans to remember, leading
to insecure practices like writing the password down on a post-it attached to
the monitor. On the other hand, a password such as "correcthorsebatterystaple"
is hard for computers to guess due to having more entropy but quite easy for
humans to remember.

Likewise hashes are hard to remember. Converting hashes to natural words is
more memorable, more fun, and more likely to be used. The generator can be
configured to generate a more funny or interesting one.
