This comic says that a password such as Tr0ub4dor&3 is bad because it is easy for password cracking software and hard for humans to remember, leading to insecure practices like writing the password down on a post-it attached to the monitor. On the other hand, a password such as \"correcthorsebatterystaple\" is hard for computers to guess due to having more entropy but quite easy for humans to remember. Likewise hashes are hard to remember. Converting hashes to natural words is more memorable, more fun, and more likely to be used. The generator can be configured to generate a more funny or interesting one.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"#introduction","text":"The comic illustrates the relative strength of passwords assuming basic knowledge of the system used to generate them.

The resulting bits are used to choose a grammatical template: article adj adj animal adj article adj animal The dictionary can be upgraded to include patterns like: verb article adj noun article adj adj noun article adv adj noun adv verb article noun and a word for each slot. The total space is around 43 bits. This may not sound like much, but it doesn't matter. Software doesn't just run on the computer -- it also runs in each of your users' heads. For many problems with user-facing software, \"adding more bits\" is the wrong solution. The right solution often involves tapping into the user's natural cognitive and social capabilities.","title":"How It Works"},{"location":"how-it-works/#how-it-works","text":"This generator performs an MD5 hash of the input.
